# Diplomacy — Rules Reference

This is the rules digest given to every LLM agent as part of its system
prompt. It is optimized for LLM context, not human reading. The order
syntax matches exactly what Meta's `diplomacy` library accepts as our
adjudicator — agents must emit orders in this exact form or they will
be rejected.

## Goal

Be the first power to **control 18 supply centers** (out of 34 on the
board). A solo victory ends the game. Anything less is a loss or a draw.

Supply centers are the principal resource that matters most in Diplomacy:
more centers means a larger army (Winter Adjustments builds one unit per
excess center) and more political weight at the table. Failing to acquire
centers leaves you weaker each year while rivals grow.

## Powers

Seven Great Powers, each starting with 3 supply centers (Russia starts
with 4). They are: **Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia,
Turkey**. Each power begins with three units (Russia: four), each on one
of its home supply centers.

## Units

- **Army (A)** — moves on land provinces.
- **Fleet (F)** — moves on sea provinces and coastal land provinces.

Each unit is identified by `<TYPE> <PROVINCE>`, e.g. `A PAR`, `F BRE`.

## Provinces

Provinces are referred to by three-letter codes (`PAR` = Paris, `BRE` =
Brest, `MAO` = Mid-Atlantic Ocean). A few provinces have multiple coasts:
notation is `STP/SC` (St. Petersburg, South Coast), `STP/NC`, `SPA/SC`,
`SPA/NC`, `BUL/EC`, `BUL/SC`. Fleets in these provinces must specify the
coast.

## Geography and adjacency

The complete adjacency table for the standard Diplomacy map is provided
below. Before issuing any move or support order, verify the source and
destination locations are adjacent according to this table. The
legal-moves list shows each unit's legal moves for the current phase;
the adjacency table is the authoritative reference for **support
legality**, where the supporter must be adjacent to the destination.

A support order requires the supporting unit to be adjacent to the
destination province. If you couldn't move there yourself, you can't
support an attack into there either. This is a common mistake: don't
issue supports for attacks into provinces your supporter can't reach.

## Phases (turn structure)

Each game year has up to five phases:

1. **Spring Movement** — every power simultaneously submits move/hold/
   support/convoy orders for each of its units.
2. **Spring Retreats** — only triggered if any unit was dislodged in
   Spring Movement. Dislodged units must retreat to a valid adjacent
   empty province or be disbanded.
3. **Fall Movement** — same as Spring Movement.
4. **Fall Retreats** — same as Spring Retreats.
5. **Winter Adjustments** — supply-center ownership is updated based on
   end-of-fall positions. Each power then builds new units (one per
   excess home center) or disbands (one per missing center) to match
   its supply-center count.

## Order syntax (EXACT strings the adjudicator accepts)

These are the only forms accepted. Anything else is rejected.

### Movement-phase orders

| Action | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Hold | `<U> H` | `A PAR H` |
| Move | `<U> - <PROV>` | `A PAR - BUR` |
| Support a holding unit | `<U> S <U2>` | `A PAR S F BRE` |
| Support a moving unit | `<U> S <U2> - <PROV>` | `A PAR S F BRE - PIC` |
| Fleet convoys an army by sea | `<F> C <A> - <PROV>` | `F MAO C A SPA - GAS` |
| Army moves via convoy | `<A> - <PROV> VIA` | `A APU - TUN VIA` |

Where `<U>` and `<U2>` are full unit identifiers (`A PAR`, `F BRE`).

### Retreat-phase orders

| Action | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Retreat to a province | `<U> R <PROV>` | `A BUR R PIC` |
| Disband (give up the unit) | `<U> D` | `A BUR D` |

### Adjustment-phase orders

| Action | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Build an army | `A <PROV> B` | `A PAR B` |
| Build a fleet | `F <PROV> B` | `F BRE B` |
| Disband a unit | `<U> D` | `A PAR D` |

Builds may only be made in *unoccupied home supply centers you still
control*. You may build at most as many units as you have excess centers.

## Adjudication essentials

These determine what actually happens when orders resolve simultaneously.

- **Equal strength stalemates** — if two units of equal strength try to
  enter the same province, neither succeeds; both bounce.
- **A support must name the exact move it backs.** Help an attack on X
  with `<U> S <U2> - X`; help a hold with `<U> S <U2>`. A wrong
  destination has no effect.
- **Attacking a supporting unit cuts its support** (drops it to zero
  strength), unless the attack comes from the province the support is
  aimed at.
- **A convoy needs two matching orders, both yours, the same turn:** the
  army orders its move with the `VIA` suffix (`A APU - TUN VIA`), and each
  fleet on the sea route convoys that exact move (`F ION C A APU - TUN`).
  `VIA` is the adjudicator's required notation for a convoyed move; it does
  not appear in normal board play. If any convoying fleet is dislodged, the
  convoy fails and the army stays put.
- **Dislodgment** — a unit forced out of its province by superior
  attacking strength is dislodged and must retreat (or disband) in the
  next retreat phase. It cannot retreat to the province the attack came
  from, nor to a province where another battle bounced.
- **You cannot dislodge your own unit.** Self-attacks and self-supports
  to dislodge yourself fail.

## Strategy / context for negotiation

Diplomacy is a *full-press* negotiation game. Between orders, powers
talk privately, in pairs, with no enforcement: any deal can be broken.

- Two units beat one. Three beat two. Convincing your neighbor to
  support your attack on a third power is the central act of the game.
- Most tactical exchanges are decided in dialogue *before* the moves
  resolve. The negotiation transcript is the real artifact.
- Trust is fragile, betrayal is expected, but reputation across many
  turns matters. A power that always betrays its allies has nobody
  willing to deal with it; a power that always honors deals gets exploited.
- The supply-center count after Fall (especially Fall 1901, Fall 1902)
  signals who is winning and reshapes alliances.
- Capturing another power's home supply center denies them that build
  slot, which is doubly advantageous to you: you gain an SC and they
  lose a build location.

## Common tactics

- **Give every unit a purpose.** Each unit should be doing something useful:
  taking a center, supporting an attack, defending a real threat, or marching
  toward the front. Holding is fine when it guards something that matters or
  baits an attacker, but a unit parked in your rear with no enemy near it is
  wasted; move it toward contested ground.
- **Reach out to distant powers when locally pressured.** If your nearest
  neighbors are coordinating against you, seek an ally further away who can
  attack one of them, forcing it to split its forces and ease the pressure
  on you.
- **Stop the leader.** A power that reaches 18 centers wins outright, so
  whoever is pulling ahead threatens everyone, allies included. When one
  power is running away with the game, the standard counter is for the rest
  to set aside their own fights and gang up on the leader, pressing it on
  several fronts at once. Watch the supply-center counts after each Fall and
  act before the leader becomes unstoppable.
- **Cut supports by moving into the supporting unit's province.** Even
  if your move bounces, the support order is cancelled. Useful when an
  attack against you depends on a single specific supporter.
- **Deny an advance with a defensive bounce.** If you expect an enemy to push
  into a key empty province, send one of your own units at it too. Equal
  strength bounces both, so the enemy is shut out of that province for the
  turn, even though you do not occupy it either. A cheap way to wall off a
  square you cannot afford to lose.
- **Use convoy to reach oversea provinces.** An army can be convoyed
  across one or more friendly fleets in sea provinces from one coast to
  another, including across multiple sea zones in a chain.
- **Time your unit placement around Winter builds.** A new build can
  only appear on a vacant home supply center you own. If you want to
  build, move existing units off your home SCs by the end of Fall.

## Common rejected order patterns to avoid

- Don't omit unit type: `PAR - BUR` is invalid, must be `A PAR - BUR`.
- Don't add extra punctuation: no periods, no quotes around orders.
- For multi-coast fleets, always specify the coast: `F STP/SC - BOT`,
  not `F STP - BOT`.
- An army can only move to an adjacent province (or be convoyed across
  contiguous sea provinces). A fleet can only move to an adjacent sea
  or coastal province along the coast it's currently on.
- Support orders must reference the supported unit's *current* type and
  location: `A PAR S F BRE - PIC` works only if there is in fact a
  `F BRE`.
